            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Ayushi Narnolia, a second-year Computer Science student specializing in AI and Machine Learning. I am passionate about solving real-world problems 
                with technology and am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and its applications.</p>
            <h4>Education and Experience:</h4>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering at VIT Vellore, specializing in AI and Machine 
                Learning. My academic journey has been complemented by several personal projects, such as developing a laser tag game application 
                for a large-scale event, which has allowed me to apply my knowledge and grow my skills in real-world scenarios.<br/>Before this, I completed 
                my 12th standard at Pace Junior Science College, where I built a strong foundation in science and mathematics, which fueled 
                my passion for technology and computer science. Prior to that, I completed my 10th standard at Vibgyor High School, 
                where I developed key academic and extracurricular skills that have shaped my educational path.
